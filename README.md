# Rover API Visualizer
This tool provides access to the Mars Rover Photos API's images and metadata through a simple GUI.

## Installation
Surely it will be as easy as launching the JAR once it is done?

## How To Use This Program
This tool operates by getting all photos taken on a specific date, accessible through a drop-down menu on the top-left
side of the screen.
 - Select a date using the drop-down menu to generate a list of all photos taken on that day.
 - Select an entry in the list to view the image and its relevant metadata.
   - The rover name, camera name, image id, subject, date, time in sols since launch, and mission launch date are all accessible.
 - Once an entry is selected, an image's source link can be viewed and copied or the image can be downloaded via the
"Copy" and "Download" buttons.
